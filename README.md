JQuery Organisation Chart Plugin

This is a small JQuery plugin that generates a hierarchical orginisational chart from a nested unordered list.

HTML/CSS purists likely would not be happy with this since it uses nested tables to achieve the layout. Nevertheless, it works pretty well and you can make nice looking interactive organisational charts with it quite easily.

This has been tested on Firefox and Chrome on Linux.
